These datapacks were created for my [AchieveToDo [BACAP]](https://modrinth.com/modpack/achievetodo) modpack but were extracted as separate projects. I hope this will be useful to someone.

This is a small datapack that fixes some minor bugs of the [BACAP](https://modrinth.com/datapack/blazeandcaves-advancements-pack):

- Fix wrong description for "Fashion Statement" advancement completion chat message.
- Fix untranslatable scoreboard titles, "Advancement Legend" completion titles, etc.

And also this datapacks adds support for some mods:

- [AdvancementsSearch](https://modrinth.com/mod/advancementssearch) - You can click on an advancement in chat to open the advancements window and highlight it.

- [Invulnerable++](https://modrinth.com/mod/invulnerable++) - Makes all trophy items invulnerable.

- [FakeItems](https://modrinth.com/mod/fakeitems) - Makes all trophies non-functional as real game items.

It is not necessary to install these mods; datapacks will work without them. I just added support for these mods.
